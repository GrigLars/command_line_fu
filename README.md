# Command Line Fu
These are just notes for command line stuff I have learned over the years: shortcuts and so on.  Some are commands that I keep forgetting, or get messed up on the order.  They are in no real order except the most recent discoveries are often on top.  Unless otherwise stated, these are CLI from bash shells on Linux.  These might also help someone else.

#### colorize log output

There is a program ccze (not a default install) which replaces colorize but is much faster.  Sadly, it doesn't page by default, so you have to modify the output to ascii and pipe it to less like so:

    ccze -A < /mnt/log/mail.log | less -R

#### remove trailing whitespace

The programs ansible-lint and git hate trailing whitespace, so often I have to remove them from a file with

    sed -i 's/\s*$//g' some_file.yml

#### telnet exit

If you need to escape linux telnet, you hit **control** + **]** which is the escape key "^]".  But you can also change it at the command prompt like:

    telnet -e Q 192.168.0.1 25 
    
Which would set the escape to "Q" 

#### kwallet issues

I kept getting errors in KDE/sddm a.k.a. Kubuntu that would pop up two dialoge boxes that said:

    Configuration file "//.config/kwalletd5rc" not writable. Please contact your system administrator.
    Configuration file "//.kde/share/config/kwalletdrc" not writable. Please contact your system administrator.
    
It did that at every fresh sddm login. For Kubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and even 18.04.  Why is this happening when I don't even USE kwallet?  I did a lot of research, and it turns out that this is due to some bug nobody has fixed for some reason when the pam.d modules are loaded, and they ask for /{$HOME}/[config stuff] and $HOME is not defined. So just disable these 4 lines in /etc/pam.d/sddm

    # -auth   optional        pam_kwallet.so
    # -auth   optional        pam_kwallet5.so

and 

    # -session optional       pam_kwallet.so auto_start
    # -session optional       pam_kwallet5.so auto_start

When you restart, those boxes go away.  I am not sure what this will do when you USE kwallet and its subsystem (probably nothing good), but that wasn't my problem.

#### Something I learned about k3b files

I had a project that I had saved in multiple k3b files.  Years and years went by. I had to see what files were saved and recreate burning audio CDs from them.  First, I had to find CD blanks.  But the next thing was "what the heck are k3b file data stored as?"  I went through a lot of research, and found they are just zipped files with metadata in an XML format stored in them as "maindata.xml."  I had to install the xsltproc and figure out the stylesheet to decode it (included in this repo).  This is imperfect, but it works.  I found out what files they had, and was able to recreate them in K3B or another burner program.

    for foo in $(ls *.k3b); do 
      unzip -p $foo maindata.xml > "$foo.xml"
      xsltproc k3b_stylesheet.xslt $foo.xml > "$foo.cd.txt"
      rm $foo.xml
    done

#### A rare Windows one: get all the system info in a dump

Sometimes I forget what this is called, like msconfig32 or wincfg32 or something.  Always forget it's:

    "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo\msinfo32.exe"

#### Seeing a conf file without comments or blank spaces

    grep -v "^#\|^$" filename.conf

#### Disabling vagrant-guest plugin for a weird vbox

Sometimes you get a weird box that doesn't want to or just can't install guest additions in VM, so you have to add some tweaks in the vagrantfile in the Vagrant.configure section (usually most of the file):

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      ....
      if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-vbguest")
        config.vbguest.auto_update = false
      end
      ....
    end

#### sort IP addresses in a sane way

    sort -n -t . -k 1,1 -k 2,2 -k 3,3 -k 4,4 ./list_of_addresses.txt

#### awk "print everything past the first two columns" 

For those times you want to weed out time stamps, this will print all but two first columns:

    awk '{$1=$2=""; print $0}' somefile


#### Some git stuff I forget

When, for some reason, my local master branch has some changes I don't care about, to reset to origin/master

    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git clean -n -f			# Clean localfiles (show only)
    git clean -f			# Clean localfiles (for reals)
    git clean -d -f 			# Also clean local directories
    
If you haven't pulled recently, when branch is out for long time and you need to add changes made to origin/master since

    git rebase master
    
#### Change default browser launched on command line in Ubuntu

    sudo update-alternatives â€“config x-www-browser

#### Add timeout option to read command, but in case of interactive execution, user can easily skip waiting.

	read -p "Press any key to continue (auto continue in 30 seconds) " -t 30 -n 1

#### AURGH which is it, adduser or useradd?

	useradd - create a user, but not set any passwords or home directories: 
		  good for scripts (useradd -D adds defaults)
	userdel - delete user (userdel -f is a complete purge of home directory, mail spool, etc)
	
	adduser - The interactive shell
	

#### Make sure you are root in a script

	if [ "$(whoami)" != 'root' ]; then
		echo -e "\e[31;1m$0: ERROR: You have no permission to run $0 as non-root user.\e[0m"
		exit 1;
	fi

#### Basic IPtables stuff

Some variables and packages in this Ubuntu example:

	SUBNETINT="192.168.11.0/24"
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade -y
	apt-get install -y netfilter-persistent

If ufw is on this system, disable it

	ufw disable

Clear out any old rules

    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
    iptables -F
    iptables -Z

Make sure we don't hang up on ourselves, and keep ssh port open

    iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

Set UDP ports for a VPN

    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport  500 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT

Set policy routing

    iptables -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir in  --proto esp -s ${SUBNETINT} -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir out  --proto esp -s ${SUBNETINT} -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -m policy --pol ipsec --dir out -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir in -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360


Block all other connections

    iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
    iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP

Save that, needs package "iptables-persistent"

    netfilter-persistent save
    netfilter-persistent reload

#### Network tools

#### Start a process on a different tty:
This was handy with the Raspberry Pi when I ssh'd in and had to display an output on the attached screen

    setsid sh -c 'exec command <> /dev/tty2 >&0 2>&1'

#### Windows instead of snipping tool shortcut

    Win + shift + s
 
#### Show what inputs are attached and to disable touchpad on Levono laptops with Ubuntu

    xinput list

You will get output like:

    Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
    Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]

#### Un-ban someone in a running "fail2ban" setup

     fail2ban-client set ssh unbanip 123.123.123.123

#### Ansible notes:
Useful for things that need separate lines:

    extra_lines: |      
      first line
      second line
      third line
      
Will display:

    1. first line
    2. second line
    3. third line

Useful for things that need to be indented but in reality is all one line

    extra_lines: >
      first line
      second line
      third line

Will display:

    first line second line third line

Other stuff:

    --forks  # The default is 5.

    ansible-playbook -u ubuntu -i inventory/dev/ec2.py --vault-password-file=~/.ssh/ansible_vault_pass.txt dev-deploy.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/dev-key.pem --limit 192.168.5.4 --list-hosts

    --check 	# Will do a dry run
    --syntax-check	# Will check yaml structure
    --list-hosts	# Will lists hosts it would run on
    
#### That software that has variables for docker in key/value pairs
- https://consul.io
- https://vaultproject.io

#### Unix permissions: dealing with my dyslexia 
The order is L->R: is User/Owner, Group, Everyone/Other

    -rwxr-xr--  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  myfile

- User has read, write, execute permissions
- Group "users" has read, execute permissions
- Everyone else has read-only permissions

chmod 0 = no permissions

#### Access control lists:
acl has to be enabled on disk first:

    /dev/sdc1   /encrypt    ext3    defaults,acl    0 0
    
Remount the disk if needed:

    mount -a -o remount    
    
set and read the acl:

    setfacl -Rm "g:dev-interface:rw" /encrypt/sftp
    getfacl /encrypt/sftp

#### VirtualBox management on command line:

Get IP address of running guest:

    VBoxManage guestproperty get {UUID no brackets} "/VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP"
    
Get list of vms/running vms:

    VBoxManage list vms/runningvms
    
#### To change the default editor in Ubuntu

    sudo update-alternatives --config editor

#### That key you like (shorter than the rest, more secure for now):

    CTRL+K : cut everything after pointer
    CTRL+A : Go the beginning of line
    CTRL+E: go to end of line
    CTRL+left/right arrow : Go to beginning of word

    CTRL+W : delete word before pointer
    CTRL+Y : paste erased

    CTRL+C : SIGTERM
    CTRL+R : Search history
    CTRL+B : move back one character
    CTRL+F : move forward one character
    CTRL+I : insert a tab
    CTRL+insert : copy
    SHIFT+insert: paste
    ALT+B : move back one word
    ALT+F : move forward one word

#### Gives you vi functionality on the command line.

    set -o vi

#### memory info

    vmstat
    free -h
    perf (command)  # May need linux-tools installed
    dstat -ta       # Live stats on cpu/disk/network

#### strace will tell you the path of every file the program tries to open.
Say you've got a utility, and you think it's trying to read a config file, but you don't know what path it's looking for. 

    strace -o [output file]

#### Find all logs which have changed within 5 minutes

    find /var/log -mmin -5 

#### Sometimes instead of netcat you can use socat. Sure it isn't as simple but has a lot more features.

    apt-get install socat

#### Packages you like (note, some may be named different in deb vs. rpm packages):
ncdu screen telnet vim-enhanced multitail lynx bind-utils curl wget openssh-clients lsof net-snmp rsync mlocate man zip unzip htop at yum-utils tree tmux policycoreutils-python boxes figlet sysstat tcpdump 

#### To check an ssh port on SELinux (you need the policycoreutils-python package):
	
    semanage port -l | grep ssh

#### To add an ssh port on SELinux:
	
    semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 222

#### Mailing when people login
In /etc/pam.d/sshd

    session    optional     pam_exec.so /usr/local/bin/send-mail-on-ssh-login.sh

#### show context in grep 2 lines before AND after

    grep -C2 "foo" ./milefile.txt
    
#### Output to clipboard

    command | xclip
    
#### For logs that get rotated, you may want tail -F or tail --follow=name so you start following the new log rather than the old file that got moved out.

    tail -F rotating.log

#### You can also tail -f multiple files simultaneously!  Package multitail also works (with color, too):
    
    tail -f /var/log/*.log is very useful!

#### To terminate an ssh session that's hung or something, type this sequence 

	[Enter] [~] [.]

More of these escape sequences can be listed with [Enter] [~] [?]

	Supported escape sequences:
	  ~.  - terminate session
	  ~B  - send a BREAK to the remote system
	  ~R  - Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only)
	  ~#  - list forwarded connections
	  ~?  - this message
	  ~~  - send the escape character by typing it twice
	(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)

#### Put in your .bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc for history control

	export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups  # no duplicate entries
	export HISTSIZE=100000                   # big big history
	export HISTFILESIZE=100000               # big big history
	shopt -s histappend                      # append to history, don't overwrite it

	# Save and reload the history after each command finishes
	export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND"


#### awk using multiple field separators, use pipe:
	
    awk -F "=|," 

#### Save a file you edited in vim without the needed permissions

	:w !sudo tee %

#### edit a command in the editor

	ctrl-x-e
	export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim (to change from nano, put in .bashrc to make permanent)

#### Runs previous command replacing foo by bar every time that foo appears

	!!:gs/foo/bar
	(As opposed to ^foo^bar, which only replaces the first occurrence of foo, this one changes every occurrence.)

#### Put a console clock in top right corner	

	while true; do echo -ne "\e[s\e[0;$((COLUMNS-27))H$(date)\e[u"; sleep 1; done &
	
#### Glob expanding

	[esc] *
	
#### Terminal emulation

	UTF-8 to get proper lines and ncurses and remove Ã¢ and so on
	
#### Replace a whole line on one match (note "dot star" at beginning and end)

	stty cols 80
	stty rows 50
	TERM=vt100; export TERM

#### Change the text and other Screensaver properties in KDE:
You need to have an ~/.xscreensaver file. There needs to be at least this line: 

		textMode:       program
		textLiteral:    XScreenSaver
		textFile:       
		textProgram:    fortune
		textURL:        http://planet.debian.org/rss20.xml
	
#### yum groups

		yum grouplist 								# Will show you list.  
		yum groupinstall "X Desktop Server" 		# Then you have to enclose it in quotes

#### List a lot of cronbtabs at once:

	ls /etc/cron* + cat
	for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
	
#### ASCII "Video" you keep forgetting:

	http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/
	
#### snmpd.conf

        $ echo "${string,,[AEIUO]}"
        a FeW WoRDS
    
string to upper case (all caps)

        $ string="a few words"
        $ echo "${string^}"
        A few words
        $ echo "${string^^}"
        A FEW WORDS
        $ echo "${string^^[aeiou]}"
        A fEw wOrds

Extract string replacing "cut" or "awk" fields

        $ STRING="username:homedir:shell"
        $ echo "$STRING"|cut -d ":" -f 3
        shell
        $ echo "${STRING##*:}"
        shell
	
Extract the value after equal character

	$ VAR="myClassName = helloClass"
	$ echo ${VAR##*= }
	helloClass

Extract text in round brackets:

	$ VAR="Hello my friend (enemy)"
	$ TEMP="${VAR##*\(}"
	$ echo "${TEMP%\)}"
	enemy

#### Enable PCRE to group in grep

	tail -f application.log | grep -i -P "(error|warning|failure)"

#### Human copy with progress bar	

	rsync -WavP --human-readable --progress

#### This is a quick step to generate self-signed certificate :

	openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 3650 -key host.key > host.cert
	#[enter *.domain.com for the Common Name]
	openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text < host.cert > host.info
	cat host.cert host.key > host.pem
	chmod 400 host.key host.pem

#### I have a keypair. How do I determine the key length?

	openssl rsa -in private.key -text -noout

The top line of the output will display the key size.

    Private-Key: (2048 bit)
	
To view the key size from a certificate:

	openssl x509 -in public.pem -text -noout | grep "RSA Public Key"
	
	RSA Public Key: (2048 bit)	

#### How do I compare a key to a cert?

	openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt | openssl md5;\
	openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in /etc/ssl/private/example.key | openssl md5


#### Print out separate colors for each output	

	for foo in $(seq 0 2); do 
		color="[3"
		color+=$(($foo + 1))
		color+="m"
		echo -e "\e$color-------\nprod-sessions-slave$foo\n"
		ssh root@prod-sessions-slave$foo.shrm.org 'df -h'
	done
	echo -e "\e[0m"
	
#### Expand via curly braces:

	for foo in server-cache-{00..12..2}; do
		echo $foo
	done

#### My rsync reminder (because I always get confused)

    rsync -auvz source/ dest/
    rsync -auvz source/ dest
    rsync -auvz source/* dest

will take all the files and subdirectories from source/ and put it into dest/	

#### Formatting time display

    function displaytime {
      local T=$1
      local D=$((T/60/60/24))
      local H=$((T/60/60%24))
      local M=$((T/60%60))
      local S=$((T%60))
      (( $D > 0 )) && printf '%d days ' $D
      (( $H > 0 )) && printf '%d hours ' $H
      (( $M > 0 )) && printf '%d minutes ' $M
      (( $D > 0 || $H > 0 || $M > 0 )) && printf 'and '
      printf '%d seconds\n' $S
    }

#### BASH Auto complete
If you happen to have the servernames listed in a textfile, or if you need to prefix your ssh connections with a username, you could create that server list file like this (with or without the username prefix, depending on how you wish to connect):

    glarson@ndi-web-dev
    glarson@ndi-portal-dev
    glarson@cache-serv001.fishbowl.punkadyne.net 

and so on.  This way, the tab completion will include your username prefix. And to utilize this particular file, you would enter something like this (of course, pointing to your particular server list, not mine):

    complete -W "`cat /home/glarson/serverlist.txt`" ssh

and again, be careful with the quotes and back-ticks.

#### READ LINES WITH SPACES AND SHIT
    
    #!/bin/bash
    file="/home/glarson/list-o-servers.txt"
    while IFS= read -r line
    do
            # display $line or do somthing with $line
            printf '%s\n' "$line"
    done <"$file"

#### You can also read field wise:

    #!/bin/bash
    file="/etc/passwd"
    while IFS=: read -r f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7
    do
            # display fields using f1, f2,..,f7
            printf 'Username: %s, Shell: %s, Home Dir: %s\n' "$f1" "$f7" "$f6"
    done <"$file"
    
#### To lock out a user account.  Several ways:

    1. passwd -l $USERACCT                  # -u is unlock, -e expire and set user to change on login
    2. chage -E 0 $USERACCT                 # Setting it to -1 will enable no expiration, otherwise, YYYY-MM-DD
    3. usermod -e 0 $USERACCT               # YYYY-MM-DD format otherwise
    4. usermod -s /sbin/nologin $USERACCT   # Not recommended but can be useful for other purposes

#### To check an ssh port on SELinux (you need the policycoreutils-python package):

	semanage port -l | grep ssh

#### To add an ssh port on SELinux:

	semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 222

#### Make a 4gb swap file

    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=4194304
    sudo mkswap /swapfile
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    sudo swapon /swapfile
    sudo echo "/swapfile none  swap  sw 0  0" >> /etc/fstab
    sudo echo "vm.swappiness=50" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
