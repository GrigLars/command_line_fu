# Command Line Fu
These are just notes for command line stuff I have learned over the years: shortcuts and so on.  Some are commands that I keep forgetting, or get messed up on the order.  They are in no real order except the most recent discoveries are often on top.  Unless otherwise stated, these are CLI from bash shells on Linux.  These might also help someone else.

#### SSH timeout on command line
Try to connect for 5 seconds, otherwise give up. 
```
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 <user>@<IP address>
````

#### Settup up forwarding
To set up forwarding for a gateway, all you have to do is run two commands on the gateway
```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <outgoing interface towards internet> -j MASQUERADE
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
````
The systems behind the gateway then have to set their gateway IP to the IP interface interface on the gateway facing them. 
```
sudo￼ip route add default via <IP of gateway interface facing them>
```
You may have to set the DNS on those systems as well, but check with a `ping 8.8.8.8` to make sure at least they can get to the internet. 

#### Timeout a runtime
The timeout command will run a command for a specified amount of time and then To run a bash script for one hour, you would use the following command:
```
timeout 3600 bash ./your_script.sh
```

#### Check if you're on x11 or Wayland
This will become more of an issue soon, I think
```
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
x11
```

#### Telnet mail commands
Because I keep having to look this up
```
EHLO test.example.com
MAIL FROM: <SENDERADDRESS>
RCPT TO: <RECIPIENTADDRESS>
DATA
Subject: Testmessage
(Blank line, press Enter again)
This is a test.
(Blank line, press Enter again)
.
QUIT
```

#### Erase something out of history
Sometimes you accidentally put something in the bash history file you need to not be saved. A quick exit from the shell without saving to history is
```
kill -9 $$
```
Which will dump you out and not save to history.

#### Test a port without "telnet"
A lot of systems can't have the telnet package for security reasons.  But there are other ways to test ports on a remote system:

Use the /dev/tcp port:
```
$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.1.4/22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2p2 Debian-6
^C pressed here
```
Use curl:
```
$ curl http://192.168.1.4:3389
curl: (7) couldn't connect to host
```
Use netcat:
```
nc -zv 10.6.0.1 80	# One port
nc -zv 10.6.0.1 80 443	# Multiple ports
nc -zv 10.6.0.1 20-29	# Port range
```

#### The ISO date format I always keep forgetting
```
date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'
2023-11-13_16-48-37
```
You can also just add timestamps by using "ts" (usually in the package more-utils):
```
echo "Hello" | ts
Dec 29 16:28:15 Hello
```
Note: "ts -r" can solve timestamps in relative format, for example:
```
$ sudo tail /var/log/syslog | ts -r
5m10s ago server-dev1 systemd[1]: fwupd-refresh.service: Succeeded.
5m10s ago server-dev1 systemd[1]: Finished Refresh fwupd metadata and update motd.
5m4s ago server-dev1 CRON[1673984]: (root) CMD (command -v debian-sa1 > /dev/null && debian-sa1 1 1)
1m4s ago server-dev1 CRON[1674253]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /opt/heatbeat.sh > /dev/null 2>&1)

4s ago server-dev1 CRON[1674280]: (root) CMD (/bin/bash /opt/heatbeat.sh > /dev/null 2>&1)
````

#### Reading data from a line to an arrary

There are ways to get a single element from a line using echo and awk:
```
$ echo "/dev/mapper/volgroup00-lv00" | awk -F'/' '{print $3}'
```

But another way can be using read to read into an array
```
PART_INFO=$(df -hT | grep ${PARTITION})		# Read in some parititon info
IFS=' ' read -ra PART_ARRAY <<< "${PART_INFO}"  # Put the partition info in an array
PART_DEV=${PART_ARRAY[0]}			# The device is the first part
PART_FS=${PART_ARRAY[1]}			# The filesystem is the second part
IFS='/' read -ra MAPPER_ARRAY <<< "${PART_DEV}" # You can further divide the device as dev, mapper, volgroup00-lv00 
```

You can also use mapfile
```
mapfile -d' ' foo <<< $(df -hT | grep /dev/mmcblk0p2); echo ${foo[1]}
```

#### Logging inside a script to an external log

I used to create a function call "fLog" that would log everything, but there's an even quicker way:
```
OUTPUT_FILE="/path/to/output.log"
echo "After this line, all output goes to $OUTPUT_FILE"
exec >> "$OUTPUT_FILE" 2>&1
```
I'd often just output things like "INFO - sometext" and "ERR - someerror" and then do a grep on $OUTPUT_FILE.  The script wouldn't output anything, but if I needed to see what the script was doing, I could comb through the log.

You can also run "script" which records a session:
```
script -a ./log_session.log
```

#### Some tips on connecting a dumb terminal to modern systemd Linux

A lot of sites tell you about /etc/inittab that don't quite work in modern systems.  Ignore those if you have systemd (which most modern systems do). In my case, I had a 9-pin serial connection at /dev/ttyS0. Here's how I found out the bit rate:

```
:~$ stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed
9600
:~$ stty -F /dev/ttyS0 115200 	# To set at 115200
:~$ stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed
115200
```
I made sure my dumb terminal was set at 8 bit per character, no parity, and 1 stop-bit.  Then, for systemd, I had to attach the serial to the getty service:

```
:~$ sudo systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS0.service --now
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/serial-getty@ttyS0.service → /lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service.
```

#### Using escape characters in bash "read" statements

I wanted to have some color to my bash prompts:

```
localhost$ read -p $'\e[31;1mEnter in your codex:\t\e[0m ' FOO; echo -e "\e[32mCodex you entered:\t\e[0;1m $FOO"
Enter in your codex:     45645674	# This will be red except for the codex entered
Codex you entered:       45645674       # This will be green except for the codex
```

#### Using ssh-agent to log in without having to do "-i" at every commandline

I had a series of boxes I had to log into via a AWS key, and I found I could just add it to a "keychain" via an agent.

```
$ ssh-agent bash
$ ssh-add ~/aws-setup-ec2-key.pem
$ ssh-add -l 	# to list what keys are loaded
```
There's also a way with passwords, if sshpass is installed. This takes a list of hosts from "hosts_file" and runs through them. Note the space in front of the "SECRETPASS," it's supposed to keep it from showing up in your history, but this is still at-your-own-risk:
```
[space] SECRETPASS="passwd123";\
for HOSTLIST in $(cat hosts_file);\
do sshpass -p $SECRETPASS ssh -q username@$HOSTLIST 'uptime';\
done
```
#### Rescuing an LVM volume/drive off a second rescue system:

Say you have an LVM-system, where the root is LVM. Some of the newer Red Hat amis on AWS have this, but this also applies to a drive rescue.  In any case, you have a "foreign LVM structure" mounted onto another system. In this case, we're going to say an AWS rescue: an fstab was improperly edited or corrupted, and the ec2 instance hangs.

First, shut down the bad instance.

Next, set up a rescue instance made with the SAME KEY as the unbootable system, with the bad volume as an attachment (but obviously not the boot/root drive), spin up the rescue instance with LVM service enabled, with the volume (or hard drive from the dead system) enabled. 

Note: if the system is working fine, and you just want to move the Volume Group (VG), then you need to mark the VG as offline and export it.

```
# vgchange -an vg_opt
 vgchange -- volume group "vg_opt" successfully deactivated

# vgexport vg_opt
 vgexport -- volume group "vg_opt" successfully exported
```

Then log on to the rescue instance using the ec2-user account with the pem key

```
ssh -i old_instance.pem ec2-user@<ip address>
```

Show that the device is attached 

```[root@ip-10-12-34-56 ~]# lsblk
NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT

  └─vg_root-app           253:2    0   15G  0 lvm
```

Run pvscan to see the LVM structure 

```
sudo pvscan
  PV /dev/xvdf4   VG vg_opt          lvm2 [<1000.00 GiB / 0    free]  
  PV /dev/xvdf2   VG vg_root         lvm2 [99.00 GiB / <26.67 GiB free]  
  Total: 2 [1.07 TiB] / in use: 2 [1.07 TiB] / in no VG: 0 [0   ] 
```

Use lvdisplay to find the correct LV to mount for the root filesystem

```
[...]
 --- Logical volume ---
  LV Path                /dev/vg_root/root   # <<<<<<<<<<  This is the path we want to use below
  LV Name                root
  VG Name                vg_root
  LV UUID                QEdQYT-6QG9-AauM-7foI-jXtQ-3lGX-l6m64c
  LV Write Access        read/write

  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           253:5
[...]
```

Note: in some cases, you might need to do a "vgimport" which is slightly different on each LVM type. For LVM1, you have to add ALL PV's if there is more than one in the VG, separated by spaces

```
vgimport vg_root 			 				# for LVM2 
vgimport vg_root /dev/xvdf2  	 			# for LVM1 as per above
vgimport vg_root /dev/xvdf2 /dev/xvdf4		# for LMV1 if there were 2 PVs

vgchange -ay vg_root						# Optional: only do this if the volume was disabled and exported
```

You should be able to mount it now, in this case /mnt 

```
[root@ip-10-12-34-56 ~]# mount /dev/vg_root/root /mnt
[root@ip-10-12-34-56 ~]# df -h /mnt

Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg_root-root  119G  7.0G   112G  38% /mnt
```

Then copy the old bad fstab to study later:

```
[root@ip-10-12-34-56 ~]# cp /mnt/etc/fstab /mnt/etc/fstab.bad.2022-12-30
```

Edit the fstab, and make the corrections. It's best to make the system *minimally bootable* but commenting out everything EXCEPT what you need: keep root, var, or whatever to make the systems bootable, and comment out an CR-ROM drives, non-root USB drives, nfs, smb, and so on. 

Shut down the rescue instance, and boot the old instance with the volume mounted as before.

Then, if it boots successfully, you can uncomment the line item in fstab one by one after after boot and do a "mount -av" to remount the filesystems on the live system.

#### The chrony equivalent to the ntpdate SERVER-ADDRESS command is:

    chronyd -q 'server SERVER-ADDRESS iburst'

Note that chronyd must not be already running, just as ntpd must not be running when setting the date with ntpdate. If that doesn't work, after that you may need an additional: 

    sudo systemctl start chronyd; sudo chronyc -a 'burst 4/4' 

#### Remove lines using sed

    sed '/^u/d' file		# Remove all lines that start with 'u'
    sed '/x$/d' file		# Remove all lines that end with 'x'
    sed '/^[A-Z]*$/d' file		# Remove all lines that have capital letters
    sed '/debian/d' file		# Remove all lines that have the word 'debian'
    sed 'M,Nd' file			# Remove lines M to N (don't forget the small d)
    sed 'Nd' file			# Remove line N from file 

#### rsync using ssh key

    rsync -auvz -e "ssh -i  ~/.ssh/somekey" codebase/foo user@hostname:/var/www/app
    
It can also pull the IdentityKey, Host, and User from `.ssh/config` if you have one.

#### Using ansible vault encryption via the command line, the short aliased version

If you have an encrypted ansible vault, with all your passwords and so on, and you have THAT locked by a password (you should), sometimes it makes the command line laborious.  I have created two aliases:

    alias apvault='ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=~/.ssh/vault_pass'
    alias avault='ansible --vault-password-file=~/.ssh/vault_pass -b'

The `~/.ssh/vault_pass` is the key and the `-b` is the "become" needed for root access when just running ansible commands. 

#### Base64 obfuscation 

Something near and dear to my heart is the openness of sharing ideas, discoveries, and code. One of my pet peeves is, every once in a while, a sysadmin or coder comes along that doesn't want to share. They use basic ways to make their code unreadable on purpose, maybe to secure their jobs, hide the fact what they don't know for better coders, or just to be difficult. This is something I ran into years ago. Say you have a script, `ten.sh`:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo "This is a bunch of numbers"
    for foo in $(seq 1 10); do echo -n "$foo - "; done

If you don't want people to see what that script is doing, you can do this:

    echo '#!/usr/bin/env bash' > secret_ten.sh && echo "echo '$(base64 ten.sh)' | base64 -d | sh" >> secret_ten.sh
    
If you `cat secret_ten.sh` you will get this:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo 'IyEvdXNyL2Jpbi9lbnYgYmFzaAplY2hvICJUaGlzIGlzIGEgYnVuY2ggb2YgbnVtYmVycyIKZm9y
    IGZvbyBpbiAkKHNlcSAxIDEwKTsgZG8gZWNobyAtbiAiJGZvbyAtICI7IGRvbmUK' | base64 -d | sh

And you can still run it.  If you want to see what that hash is, just edit `secret_ten.sh` and remove the `| sh` at the end.  There are "more secure" ways to make this even harder to decode, but I don't want to encourage this behavior. I have some advice for people who do this, and things like it, to "secure their jobs."  I have seen so many sysadmins and coders get let go anyway, either because they are not as valuable as they thought they were, or get let go by management who doesn't even know their value, no matter how obvious or stubborn you are.  All you're doing is making it hard for other coders down the line. And you might think, "well, who cares about them, I'm out of a job," and you're part of the problem, I'm afraid.

#### Sort text file and remove duplicates in place

    sort -uo filename.list filename.list

#### Remove duplicates in a text file without sorting first

    awk '!x[$0]++' /etc/postfix/transport > /tmp/transport_dupes_removed

#### Find your IP on the command line

	curl ifconfig.me
	curl -4/-6 icanhazip.com
	curl ipinfo.io/ip
	curl api.ipify.org
	curl checkip.dyndns.org
	hostname -i

#### Making a RAM disk to install an entire OS guest into memory

Sometimes I am just testing an new concept or distro, and I install in directly to RAM. RAM is cheap these days, and why clutter my hard drive and wear down my SSD with files I am gonna delete right away, anyway?

    sudo mkdir /tmp/ramdisk
    sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=12G vmramdisk /tmp/ramdisk
    mount | tail -n 1
    
Then I set the install directory to /tmp/ramdisk, play with it, then destroy it. If I need the RAM back, I can just unmount it.

    sudo umount /tmp/ramdisk/

Or make the RAM disk permenant and persistent (athough data will be wiped between reboots).

    vmramdisk  /tmp/ramdisk  tmpfs  defaults,size=12G,x-gvfs-show  0  0    

#### Quick mount of a samba/smb/cifs share ####

    sudo mount -t cifs //diskstation.int.local/Fortran /media/diskstation/fortran -o user=cforrester
    passwd: ****************

#### Visual readout of processes ####

I had an issue where I had to keep an eye out for runaway php processes, and have a more visual way to eyeball it on another screen.  I whipped up this little one-liner to show me the number of php proccesses every 10 seconds:

    while true; do date | tr -d '\n'; foo=$(nice ps aux | grep php | wc -l);\
    echo -n " :: $foo"; printf '%*s' $foo | tr ' ' '*'; echo; sleep 10; done

This prints out a crude bar graph:

#### Adding a user with no password ####

    adduser --shell /bin/bash --disabled-password jenkins

#### Quick Guide to expanding disk size on VMware with Debian/Ubuntu and hoping it's using LVM ####

This assumes that the first disk is **/dev/sda**, and you're adding a third **[3]** partition and using LVM

- Power off the virtual machine
- Extend the virtual disk size
- Power on machine
- ```sudo fdisk /dev/sda```
- p,n,p,3[probably],[enter][enter],t,3[probably],8e[LVM type],w
- Restart machine
- ```sudo pvcreate /dev/sda3```
- ```sudo vgextend vgubuntu /dev/sda3```
- ```sudo vgdisplay vgubuntu | grep "Free"```
- ```sudo lvextend -L+##G /dev/vgubuntu/root``` [where ## is the GB size from previous step]
- ```sudo resize2fs /dev/vgubuntu/root``` [use ext2online if resize2fs gives an error about live filesystems]
- You can also use "lvextend -r" instead of resize2fs or xfs_growfs
- Pray

#### Quick Guide to expanding EBS disk size on AWS with Debian/Ubuntu [LVM not needed] ####

- Expend the EBS in the console or ```aws ec2 modify-volume --size 150 --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0``` where 150 is the size in GB
- Then ssh into the instance, check with ```sudo lsblk``` and ```df -h```
- ```sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1``` where xvda 1 [note the space] is the disk volume, parition 1
- ```sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1``` where xvda1 [no space] is the partition you expanded above
- Prayer not needed

#### Quick Guide to expanding EBS disk size on AWS with Debian/Ubuntu with XFS ####
- Expend the EBS in the console or ```aws ec2 modify-volume --size 150 --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0``` where 150 is the size in GB
- Then ssh into the instance, check with ```sudo lsblk``` and ```df -h```
- ```xfs_growfs /mnt``` where /mnt is the mounted disk volume
- ```xfs_fsr``` to optimize
Note: AWS takes a LONG time to optimize from the EBS, and depending on size, may not be done for several hours to half a day. 

#### Removing files over X days old ####

    find /path/to/files* -mtime +5 -exec rm -i {} \;

In this case, 5. Note that there are spaces between rm, {}, and \; and I put an -i for safety in case one cut and pastes. I then hand-fix it to -rf or -r depending on what I need.  Often I am removing log files over 60 days old to save space on really small systems. 

If you are dealing with files, the difference is between mtime, ctime and atime is:

* atime _"access time,"_ is updated when the file's contents are read by an application or a command such as less, grep, or cat.
* ctime _"change time,"_ is when the file's property changes. It will always be changed when the mtime changes, but also when you change the file's permissions, name or location.
* mtime _"modification time,"_ is when the file was last modified. When you change the contents of a file, its mtime changes.

The easiest way to remember which is which is to read their alphabetical order:

* *A*time can be updated alone
* *C*time will update atime
* *M*time will update both atime and ctime.

#### Changing your sudoers file to lecture differently ####

You can change the message you get when someone logs into sudo.  Set lecture=always, never, or once and the message can be set to a text file

    Defaults    lecture=once,lecture_file=/etc/sudo_lecture.txt
    # sudo --reset-timestamp # To reset this "once"
    Defaults 	insults
    # You can insult people who get the sudo password wrong, too

#### Using awk to show lines that have a match in a column ####

Suppose you have an output with columns, and the first, second, or nth column has a match you're looking for, and if that column matches, you print the entire line.  You can use awk, which is designed for this:

    awk '$2 == "LINUX" { print $0 }' test.txt	# Show lines that have LINUX in the second column
    iptables -vL | awk '$1 > 0 { print $0 }'	# Show output of IP tables when the first column (packet hits) is greater than zero
    
#### Regex for email and ip addresses

    grep -E -o "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}\b" email_log.log
    grep -E -o "(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)" list_of_maybe_ips.txt

#### Getting keys and values from bash associative arrays
The keys are accessed using an exclamation point: `${!array[@]}`, the values are accessed using `${array[@]}`

    for i in "${!array[@]}" 
    do
      echo "key  : $i"
      echo "value: ${array[$i]}"
    done

In standard bash arrays, `${!array[@]}` will list indecies, like 0 1 2 ..*n* 

#### How to make a sudoer be able to sudo with no password
If you create a file in `/etc/sudoers.d/<username>` and understand that this is a vulnerability you need to secure HARD... add the line:

    <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

#### You can substitute command output for files
You can substitute commands for files using parentheses.  For example:

    diff <(ls Directory/*.png) <(ls Backups/*.png)
    
#### Move files with ad-hoc web server

    python3 -m http.server [port number]
    wget http://<hostip>:[port number]/filename
    
Launch the web server [default port 8000] and transfer files that way.  Note: only do this on private networks. 

#### Read JSON files in a sane way

    cat test.json | python -mjson.tool
    cat test.json | jq
    
Note, either python or jq have to be installed, respecively. 

#### How to connect to an ansible host NOT in inventory (yet)
Surprisingly, the trick is to append a comma (,) 

    # Host and IP address
    ansible all -i example.com,
    ansible all -i 93.184.216.119,

    # Requires 'hosts: all' in your playbook
    ansible-playbook -i example.com, playbook.yml

#### Have bash determine what quotes to use

    $ # "Nothing's worth more than $20," according to Jim.
    $ !:q
    '# "Nothing'\''s worth more than $20," according to Jim.'

    $ echo '# "Nothing'\''s worth more than $20," according to Jim.'
    # "Nothing's worth more than $20," according to Jim.

#### Update and remove all stale vagrant boxes
To update all your vagrant boxes:

    vagrant box list | while read line; do BOX=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}'); vagrant box update --box $BOX; done
    
To update and prune all your outdated boxes, even ones in use:

    vagrant box list | while read line; do BOX=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}'); vagrant box update --box $BOX; done && vagrant box prune -f
    
I have a lot of aliases for vagrant because I use it a LOT:

    alias vagpro='vagrant provision'
    alias vagredo='vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up'
    alias vagrm='vagrant destroy -f'
    alias vagssh='vagrant ssh'
    alias vagstat='vagrant global-status'
    alias vagupdate="vagrant box list | while read line; do BOX=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}'); vagrant box update --box $BOX; done"
    alias vagtrim="vagrant box list | while read line; do BOX=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}'); vagrant box update --box $BOX; done && vagrant box prune -f"
    alias vagwho='vagrant global-status'
    alias vgdn='vagrant halt'
    alias vgdown='vagrant halt'
    alias vgssh='vagrant ssh'
    alias vgup='vagrant up'
    
#### Searching for all active crontab jobs
I have found myself in multiple jobs trying to figure out all kinds of cron jobs that are not standardized when I take over a server. Are they in /etc/crontab? Running as a crontab of a user? Something in one of the hours jobs? I developed these four lines of code to find them quickly.

    # Any active jobs in /etc/crontab
      grep -v "^#\|^$" /etc/crontab
    # Any active jobs in the timed directories
      for foo in hourly daily weekly monthly; do echo "==== Cron directory $foo>"; ls /etc/cron.$foo; done
    # Any active jobs in the cron.d directory
      ls /etc/cron.d/*   # grep -v "^#\|^$"
    # Any cron jobs in user crontabs
      for foo in $(ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs/*); do echo "==== User Crontab $foo>"; grep -v "^#\|^$" $foo; done

#### How to List All Running Services Under systemd 

    sudo systemctl --type=service
    sudo systemctl list-units --type=service
    sudo systemctl --type=service --state=active
    sudo systemctl --type=service --state=running
    
Your best bet is to run this as an alias:

    alias sys_active='sudo systemctl --type=service --state=active'
    alias sys_run='sudo systemctl --type=service --state=running'

#### How to run a command for a certain length of time

    timeout 8s ping 192.168.1.1

#### Am I running Raspbian 32 bit or 64 bit?

Run "uname -m" to confirm. If it says aarch64 then it is 64 bit. If it says armv7l then it is 32 bit.  If it says armv61, it's also 32 bit.

#### Check what SSL/TLS client connection you get

This is helpful to find the highest level of TLS that you support.

	openssl s_client -connect [domain]:443 -[tls1/tls1_1/tls1_2/tls1_3]

#### Put your last long command in your editor

Sometimes, you have a long command that you need to edit by hand or swap some stuff out.  Like say you had 

	ansible-playbook -T 60 --extra-vars="foo=bar bar=baz xyzzy=plugh" install-rsyslog-client.yml --vault-password-file=~/.ssh/vault_pass -l manny,mo,jack,cecil,beany,potato1,orangepi1,yakko,rpi-*
	
and the next command, substitute a lot of stuff no easy in one command, run:

	fc
	
It will open up that command in your DEFAULT text editor. What, it's crummy old nano?  Change it to vim.  Open the .bashrc file, and replace both occurrences of program with the editor you want to set as the default editor:

	export EDITOR='vim'
	export VISUAL='vim'
	
Save and reload with "source .basrc"

#### How to measure GPU and CPU temp on a Raspberry Pi

Why was this so hard to find?

    vcgencmd measure_temp
    cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp

#### More on stdout and stderr

After the post below, I needed a reminder when I look at this page again.

    Handle	Name	Description
    0   	stdin	Standard input
    1   	stdout	Standard output
    2   	stderr	Standard error

    command &>file		# ... OR
    command > file-name 2>&1	# ... pipes both stdout and stderr in a file
    command 2>&1 | less		# ... it can also be piped            
    
    command 2> error.logr.log 	# put only stderr in a log
            
You can also pipe both standard output and standard error into the next stage of the pipeline like this:

	if doesnotexist |& grep 'command not found' >/dev/null
	then
	  echo "oops"
	fi

#### How to grep docker logs

This just seems super annoying, but you have to push all the output to stdout, then grep it, like this example [-f is otional "follow" which I use more often than not]:

    docker logs -f 2434326a55f9 2>&1 | grep "No protocol specified"

#### How to show “Hybrid” line numbers in Vim

	set number
	set relativenumber
	
You can also put the following two config directives in ~/.vimrc

#### For Excel or CSV files

**csvkit** provides in2csv, csvcut, csvjoin, csvgrep, etc.

#### Ah, crap, I didn't mean to type that long command yet, but I don't want to retype it

You can hit **alt+shift+3** which will put a "#" comment in front of it so you can go back to it later in your bash history

#### Some cool hardware reading tricks

What does this box have?  I knew a lot like dmidecde, dmesg, and kernel logs, but there are some new ones:

    # Read BIOS settings
    dd if=/dev/mem bs=1k skip=768 count=256 2>/dev/null | strings -n 8  
    
    lspci -tv    # Show PCI devices
    lsusb -tv    # Show USB devices
    lshal        # Show a list of all devices with their properties
    lsdev        # Information about installed hardware (procinfo has to be installed)
    lshw         # Information about installed hardware

#### How do I prevent a cron job from running over itself if it takes too long?

Use flock (part of the util-linux or flock suite of tools depending on distro).

    $ crontab -l
    * * * * * /usr/bin/flock -w 0 /path/to/cron.lock /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron.php

You can also use fuser to see who and what are using them

	$ fuser -v /path/to/cron.lock
			     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
	cron.lock:           root       7836 f.... flock
			     root       7837 f.... php

#### colorize log output

There is a program ccze (not a default install) which replaces colorize but is much faster.  Sadly, it doesn't page by default, so you have to modify the output to ascii and pipe it to less like so:

    ccze -A < /mnt/log/mail.log | less -R

#### remove trailing whitespace

The programs ansible-lint and git hate trailing whitespace, so often I have to remove them from a file with

    sed -i 's/\s*$//g' some_file.yml

#### telnet exit

If you need to escape linux telnet, you hit **control** + **]** which is the escape key "^]".  But you can also change it at the command prompt like:

    telnet -e Q 192.168.0.1 25 
    
Which would set the escape to "Q" 

#### kwallet issues

I kept getting errors in KDE/sddm a.k.a. Kubuntu that would pop up two dialoge boxes that said:

    Configuration file "//.config/kwalletd5rc" not writable. Please contact your system administrator.
    Configuration file "//.kde/share/config/kwalletdrc" not writable. Please contact your system administrator.
    
It did that at every fresh sddm login. For Kubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and even 18.04.  Why is this happening when I don't even USE kwallet?  I did a lot of research, and it turns out that this is due to some bug nobody has fixed for some reason when the pam.d modules are loaded, and they ask for /{$HOME}/[config stuff] and $HOME is not defined. So just disable these 4 lines in /etc/pam.d/sddm

    # -auth   optional        pam_kwallet.so
    # -auth   optional        pam_kwallet5.so

and 

    # -session optional       pam_kwallet.so auto_start
    # -session optional       pam_kwallet5.so auto_start

When you restart, those boxes go away.  I am not sure what this will do when you USE kwallet and its subsystem (probably nothing good), but that wasn't my problem.

#### Something I learned about k3b files

I had a project that I had saved in multiple k3b files.  Years and years went by. I had to see what files were saved and recreate burning audio CDs from them.  First, I had to find CD blanks.  But the next thing was "what the heck are k3b file data stored as?"  I went through a lot of research, and found they are just zipped files with metadata in an XML format stored in them as "maindata.xml."  I had to install the xsltproc and figure out the stylesheet to decode it (included in this repo).  This is imperfect, but it works.  I found out what files they had, and was able to recreate them in K3B or another burner program.

    for foo in $(ls *.k3b); do 
      unzip -p $foo maindata.xml > "$foo.xml"
      xsltproc k3b_stylesheet.xslt $foo.xml > "$foo.cd.txt"
      rm $foo.xml
    done

#### A rare Windows one: get all the system info in a dump

Sometimes I forget what this is called, like msconfig32 or wincfg32 or something.  Always forget it's:

    "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo\msinfo32.exe"

#### Seeing a conf file without comments or blank spaces

    grep -v "^#\|^$" filename.conf

#### Disabling vagrant-guest plugin for a weird vbox

Sometimes you get a weird box that doesn't want to or just can't install guest additions in VM, so you have to add some tweaks in the vagrantfile in the Vagrant.configure section (usually most of the file):

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      ....
      if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-vbguest")
        config.vbguest.auto_update = false
      end
      ....
    end

#### sort IP addresses in a sane way

    sort -n -t . -k 1,1 -k 2,2 -k 3,3 -k 4,4 ./list_of_addresses.txt

#### awk "print everything past the first two columns" 

For those times you want to weed out time stamps, this will print all but two first columns:

    awk '{$1=$2=""; print $0}' somefile
    
Find the index where you want to start printing (index of $5 in $0) and print the substring of $0 starting at that index.

    awk '{print substr($0,index($0,$5))}' fileName

#### Some git stuff I forget

When, for some reason, my local master branch has some changes I don't care about, to reset to origin/master

    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git clean -n -f			# Clean localfiles (show only)
    git clean -f			# Clean localfiles (for reals)
    git clean -d -f 			# Also clean local directories
    
If you haven't pulled recently, when branch is out for long time and you need to add changes made to origin/master since

    git rebase master
    
#### Change default browser launched on command line in Ubuntu

    sudo update-alternatives –config x-www-browser

#### Add timeout option to read command, but in case of interactive execution, user can easily skip waiting.

	read -p "Press any key to continue (auto continue in 30 seconds) " -t 30 -n 1

#### AURGH which is it, adduser or useradd?

	useradd - create a user, but not set any passwords or home directories: 
		  good for scripts (useradd -D adds defaults)
	userdel - delete user (userdel -f is a complete purge of home directory, mail spool, etc)
	
	adduser - The interactive shell
	

#### Make sure you are root in a script

	if [ "$(whoami)" != 'root' ]; then
		echo -e "\e[31;1m$0: ERROR: You have no permission to run $0 as non-root user.\e[0m"
		exit 1;
	fi

#### Basic IPtables stuff

	SUBNETINT="192.168.11.0/24"
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade -y
	apt-get install -y netfilter-persistent

If ufw is on this system, disable it

	ufw disable

Clear out any old rules

    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT

    iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

Set UDP ports for a VPN

    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport  500 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT

Set policy routing

    iptables -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir in  --proto esp -s ${SUBNETINT} -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir out  --proto esp -s ${SUBNETINT} -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -m policy --pol ipsec --dir out -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD --match policy --pol ipsec --dir in -s ${SUBNETINT} -o eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360

    command | xclip
    
#### For logs that get rotated, you may want tail -F or tail --follow=name so you start following the new log rather than the old file that got moved out.

    tail -F rotating.log

#### You can also tail -f multiple files simultaneously!  Package multitail also works (with color, too):
    
    tail -f /var/log/*.log is very useful!

#### To terminate an ssh session that's hung or something, type this sequence 

	[Enter] [~] [.]

	  ~B  - send a BREAK to the remote system
	  ~R  - Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only)
	  ~#  - list forwarded connections
	  ~?  - this message
	  ~~  - send the escape character by typing it twice
	(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)

        a FeW WoRDS
    
string to upper case (all caps)

        $ string="a few words"
        $ echo "${string^}"
        A few words
        $ echo "${string^^}"
        A FEW WORDS
        $ echo "${string^^[aeiou]}"
        A fEw wOrds

Extract string replacing "cut" or "awk" fields

        $ STRING="username:homedir:shell"
        $ echo "$STRING"|cut -d ":" -f 3
        shell

#### Enable PCRE to group in grep

	tail -f application.log | grep -i -P "(error|warning|failure)"

#### Human copy with progress bar	

	rsync -WavP --human-readable --progress

#### Generate various SSL certificate, when a CSR has to be sent to a signing authority, which also creates new key:

Regular cert:

    foo=example.com; \
    openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out "$foo.csr" \
    -keyout "$foo.key" \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=Your City/O=Company Name/CN=$foo"

Wildcard cert:

     foo=example.com; \
     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out "star_$foo.csr" \
     -keyout "star_$foo.key" \
     -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=Your City/O=Company Name/CN=*.$foo"

#### This is a quick step to generate self-signed certificate :

	openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 3650 -key host.key > host.cert
	#[enter *.domain.com for the Common Name]
	openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text < host.cert > host.info
	cat host.cert host.key > host.pem
	chmod 400 host.key host.pem

#### I have a keypair. How do I determine the key length?

	openssl rsa -in private.key -text -noout

The top line of the output will display the key size.

    Private-Key: (2048 bit)
	
To view the key size from a certificate:

	openssl x509 -in public.pem -text -noout | grep "RSA Public Key"
	
	RSA Public Key: (2048 bit)	

#### How do I compare a key to a cert?

	openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt | openssl md5;\
	openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in /etc/ssl/private/example.key | openssl md5

#### Get expiration of certificate for various protocols: file, https, pop3, imap, smtps, starttls

	openssl x509 -noout -in server_file.crt -enddate
	echo | openssl s_client -servername https_hostname.com -connect hostname.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
	echo | openssl s_client -connect pop3_hostname.com:995 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
	echo | openssl s_client -connect imap_hostname.com:993 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
	echo | openssl s_client -connect smtps_hostname.com:465 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
	echo | openssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect starttls_hostname.com:587 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
	

#### Print out separate colors for each output	

	for foo in $(seq 0 2); do 
		color="[3"
		color+=$(($foo + 1))
		color+="m"
		echo -e "\e$color-------\nprod-sessions-slave$foo\n"
		ssh root@prod-sessions-slave$foo.shrm.org 'df -h'
	done
	echo -e "\e[0m"
	
#### Expand via curly braces:

	for foo in server-cache-{00..12..2}; do
		echo $foo
	done

#### My rsync reminder (because I always get confused)

    rsync -auvz source/ dest/
    rsync -auvz source/ dest
    rsync -auvz source/* dest

will take all the files and subdirectories from source/ and put it into dest/	

#### Formatting time display

    function displaytime {
      local T=$1
      local D=$((T/60/60/24))
      local H=$((T/60/60%24))
      local M=$((T/60%60))
      local S=$((T%60))
      (( $D > 0 )) && printf '%d days ' $D
      (( $H > 0 )) && printf '%d hours ' $H
      (( $M > 0 )) && printf '%d minutes ' $M
      (( $D > 0 || $H > 0 || $M > 0 )) && printf 'and '
      printf '%d seconds\n' $S
    }

#### BASH Auto complete
If you happen to have the servernames listed in a textfile, or if you need to prefix your ssh connections with a username, you could create that server list file like this (with or without the username prefix, depending on how you wish to connect):

    glarson@ndi-web-dev
    glarson@ndi-portal-dev
    glarson@cache-serv001.fishbowl.punkadyne.net 

and so on.  This way, the tab completion will include your username prefix. And to utilize this particular file, you would enter something like this (of course, pointing to your particular server list, not mine):

    complete -W "`cat /home/glarson/serverlist.txt`" ssh

and again, be careful with the quotes and back-ticks.

#### READ LINES WITH SPACES AND STUFF
    
    #!/bin/bash
    file="/home/glarson/list-o-servers.txt"
    while IFS= read -r line
    do
            # display $line or do somthing with $line
            printf '%s\n' "$line"
    done <"$file"

#### You can also read field wise:

    #!/bin/bash
    file="/etc/passwd"
    while IFS=: read -r f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7
    do
            # display fields using f1, f2,..,f7
            printf 'Username: %s, Shell: %s, Home Dir: %s\n' "$f1" "$f7" "$f6"
    done <"$file"
    
#### To lock out a user account.  Several ways:

    1. passwd -l $USERACCT                  # -u is unlock, -e expire and set user to change on login
    2. chage -E 0 $USERACCT                 # Setting it to -1 will enable no expiration, otherwise, YYYY-MM-DD
    3. usermod -e 0 $USERACCT               # YYYY-MM-DD format otherwise
    4. usermod -s /sbin/nologin $USERACCT   # Not recommended but can be useful for other purposes

#### To check an ssh port on SELinux (you need the policycoreutils-python package):

	semanage port -l | grep ssh

#### To add an ssh port on SELinux:

	semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 222

#### Make a 4gb swap file

    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=4194304
    sudo mkswap /swapfile
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    sudo swapon /swapfile
    sudo echo "/swapfile none  swap  sw 0  0" >> /etc/fstab
    sudo echo "vm.swappiness=50" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
